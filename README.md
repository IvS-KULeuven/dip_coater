# The Dip Coater App

This small App is developed for IvS to drive the motor for the dip coater. The motor is connected to a Raspberry Pi through the GPIO bus.

This App is developed with [Textual](https://www.textualize.io).

## Installation

Always install in a dedicated virtual environment!

```bash
$ cd </path/to/dip-coater>
$ python3 -m venv venv --prompt=dip-coater
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
$ pip install -e .
```

On a Raspberry Pi, install the project together with the RPi package:

```bash
$ pip install dip-coater[rpi] 
```

When you want to develop and test on a macOS or Linux system, install without the RPi package. The App will mock the imports and functions.

```bash
$ pip install dip-coater
```

## Usage

Start the App from the command line in a terminal. You can start it also from a remote ssh session in a terminal, e.g. if you have the installation on the Raspberry Pi and you have a remote connection to your RPi.

```bash
$ dip-coater
```

This will show the following App in your terminal:
